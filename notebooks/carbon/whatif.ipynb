These objects contain information related to harvest, planting, tillage, organic amendments, and fertilization applications.

    " * `scenario_seasonal_fields: List[SeasonalFieldInformation]`: Containing information about agriculture activities to be performed for at least **two calendar years** following seasons after `baseline_seasonal_fields`. Similar to the baseline_seasonal_fields, each `SeasonalFieldInformation` object stores farming information for each crop year.\n",
