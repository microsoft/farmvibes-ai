    "The current script in this notebook is configured to download a remote raster image and generate shape files marking similar regions. This is useful in detecting portions of land affected by weeds. The workflow accepts a signed URL to a remote raster image, such as a [shared access signature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) for images stored in Azure, and a geometry for the area of interest. The workflow downloads the raster and trains a Gaussian Mixture Model to group similar regions. The workflow outputs a zip archive with each of the shapefiles defining the partitions.\n",

    "Below are the main libraries used for this example and other useful links:\n",
    "- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is a python package that provides powerful N-dimensional array object, broadcasting functions and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.\n",
    "- [pandas](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both easy and intuitive.\n",
    "- [rasterio](https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio) is a library for reading and writing geospatial raster data. It is used on torchgeo and rioxarray. It is a good option when reading/writing GeoTIFFs.\n",
    "- [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) is a Python package for machine learning built on top of SciPy. It Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.\n",

    "- samples: [int] The number of pixels to sample from the input image. We donâ€™t build the model with all pixels in the image. Rather, we randomly select a subset of pixels to sample when building the model.\n",
    "- buffer: [int] An offset from each edge of the raster that should be ignored by the pipeline. Negative numbers push the boundary in.\n",
    "- no_data: [int] The value to use as nodata when reading the Raster. Default: None (use the raster's default nodata value)\n",

    "- sieve_size: [int] This is the cutoff for determining if a region is too small to be included\n",
    "- simplify: One of [\"none\", \"simplify\", \"convex\"] This is the option for simplifying the borders of regions. Options are: [Convex, Simplify, None]\n",
    "- tolerance: [float] This is the tolerance used in simplification. All parts of a geometry will be no more than tolerance distance from the original. See GeoSeries.simplify for more documentation.\n",
    "- bands: [List[int]] The bands to select for comparison. Default [] (all bands)\n",
