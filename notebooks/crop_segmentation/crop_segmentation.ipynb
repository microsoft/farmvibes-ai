    "### Notebook outline\n",
    "The user provides a geographical region and a date range of interest, which are used as input to a FarmVibes.AI workflow that generates the dataset for this task. The workflow consists of downloading and preprocessing Sentinel-2 data, running SpaceEye to obtain cloud-free imagery, and computing daily NDVI indexes at 10m resolution. It also downloads CDL maps in the same time frame at 30m resolution, upsampling them to 10m resolution via nearest neighbor interpolation to be used as ground-truth labels.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As each CDL map represents a single year, we combine multiple NDVI rasters along the year, stacking in the channel dimension a number of rasters equal to `NDVI_STACK_BANDS`. In this notebook, we set `NDVI_STACK_BANDS = 37`, which means a 10-day interval between each ndvi raster of a year. During training, we extract chips/patches from the NDVI stacks and CDL maps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the main libraries used for this example and other useful links:\n",
    "- [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) is used as our deep learning framework.\n",
    "- [TorchGeo](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo) is a library built for training models on geospatial data. We use it to dinamically sample fixed-sized chips to train/evaluate our model. We define torchgeo dataset at lib/datasets.py\n",
    "- [Pytorch-Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning) is wrapper over pytorch to reduce boilerplate code for training and evaluating models. We define lightning modules at lib/modules.py.\n",
    "- [Shapely](https://github.com/shapely/shapely) is a library for manipulating geometric shapes.\n",
    "- [Geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas) is an extension of the popular pandas library to add support for geographic data. It uses shapely objects in its geometry column, and understands coordinate systems. We use it to visualize the training/validation RoIs. It is also quite useful for transforming geometries between different CRSs.\n",
    "- [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and the extension [rioxarray](https://github.com/corteva/rioxarray) are used for merging and visualizing predictions.\n",
    "- [rasterio](https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio) is a library for reading and writing geospatial raster data. It is used on torchgeo and rioxarray. It is a good option when reading/writing GeoTIFFs.\n",
    "- [onnx](https://onnx.ai/get-started.html) is a library for exporting machine learning models to a interoperable format. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code organization\n",
    "The training code is mainly organized into four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The datasets (`notebook_lib/datasets.py`) inherit from torchgeo's `RasterDataset` and are used to read and preprocess the CDL and NDVI data produced by FarmVibes.AI platform. For those familiar with pytorch, these datasets are indexed by a spatiotemporal bounding box instead of integer. If you want to add new datasets, you can use these as a base (and check [torchgeo documentation](https://torchgeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).\n",
    "- The lightning data module (`notebook_lib/modules.py`) contains the code for samplers and data loaders. If you want to change the data split, how to load data, which crops to use, this is probably where you should go to. Also check [pytorch-lightning documentation](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "- The lightning module (`notebook_lib/models.py`) contains the code for running/training/evaluating the neural network: instantiating the neural network, training steps, computing metrics, and others. If you want to change the architecure, the loss, and generally how the model is trained, this is probably where you should go to. Also check [pytorch-lightning documentation](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "- Two utility subpackages (`notebook_lib/utils.py` and `notebook_lib/constants.py`) with supporting code for monitoring the workflow execution, defining crop indexes constants, etc."
