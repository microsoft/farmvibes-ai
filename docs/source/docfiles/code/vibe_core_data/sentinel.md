# Sentinel

The `vibe_core.data.sentinel` module extends the core data module to handle specific data types related to Sentinel satellite products. It provides classes for representing Sentinel product metadata, rasters, and sequences, making it easier to work with data obtained from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites.

In addition to handling Sentinel products, the module also includes classes for handling SpaceEye rasters and sequences, further expanding its capabilities in the domain of satellite data processing and analysis.
