# Farm

The `vibe_core.data.farm` module provides data classes for representing various agricultural operations and practices in a farm, such as tillage, fertilization, organic amendments, and harvests. This module simplifies the process of managing and organizing farm-related data and offers specialized data types for integrating with Azure Data Manager for Agriculture (ADMAg).
