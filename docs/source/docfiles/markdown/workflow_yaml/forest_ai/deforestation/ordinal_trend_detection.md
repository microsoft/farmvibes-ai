# forest_ai/deforestation/ordinal_trend_detection

Detects increase/decrease trends in the pixel levels over the user-input geometry and time range. This workflow prepares rasters to perform the Cochran-Armitage trend test over a user-provided geometry and time range. Initially, it recodes the input raster according to the 'from_values' and 'to_values' parameters. For example, if the original raster has values (2, 1, 3, 4, 5) and the default values of 'from_values' and 'to_values' are respectively [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the recoded raster will have values (7, 6, 8, 9, 10).  The workflow then clips the user-provided geometries and computes an ordinal raster. It also counts each unique pixel present in the recoded rasters to create a pixel frequency contingency table. This data is used to determine if there is an increasing or decreasing trend in pixel levels.  The Cochran-Armitage test is a non-parametric test used to ascertain this trend. The null hypothesis assumes no trend in pixel levels, while the alternative hypothesis assumes a trend exists. The test returns a p-value and a z-score. If the p-value is less than some significance level, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative. A positive z-score indicates an increasing trend, while a negative one indicates a decreasing trend.
