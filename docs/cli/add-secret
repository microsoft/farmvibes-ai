@SCRIPTNAME@ add-secret <key> <value>

Adds a secret with a key <key> and value <value>.

Secrets are used in ops with the @SECRET parameter. For example,
"@SECRET(eywa-secrets, pc-sub-key)" in which "pc-sub-key" is the key and
eywa-secrets is the key-vault. Key-vaults are only required for an Azure
instalation. For this local farmvibes.ai instalation, the key-vault can be any
non-empty string.
