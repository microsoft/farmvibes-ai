  short_description:
    Performs SpaceEye inference to generate daily cloud-free images given Sentinel data and cloud
    masks.
  long_description: >-
    The workflow will group input Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and cloud mask rasters into
    spatio-temporal windows and perform inference of each window. The windows will then be merged
    into rasters for the RoI. More information about SpaceEye available in the paper:
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08408.
  sources:
    input_data:
      Time range and region of interest. Will determine the spatio-temporal windows and region for
      the output rasters.
    s1_rasters: Sentinel-1 rasters tiled to the Sentinel-2 grid.
    s2_rasters: Sentinel-2 tile rasters for the input time range.
    cloud_rasters: Cloud masks for each of the Sentinel-2 tiles.
  sinks:
    raster: Cloud-free rasters for the input time range and region of interest.
  parameters:
    duration:
      Time window, in days, considered in the inference. Controls the amount of temporal context for
      inpainting clouds. Larger windows require more compute and memory.
    time_overlap:
      Overlap ratio of each temporal window. Controls the temporal step between windows as a
      fraction of the window size.
