description:
  short_description:
    Runs the SpaceEye cloud removal pipeline using an interpolation-based algorithm, yielding daily
    cloud-free images for the input geometry and time range.
  long_description: >-
    The workflow fetches Sentinel-2 tiles that cover the input geometry and time range, preprocesses
    them, computes cloud masks, and runs SpaceEye inference in a sliding window on the retrieved
    tiles. This workflow can be reused as a preprocess step in many applications that require
    cloud-free Sentinel-2 data. For more information about SpaceEye, read the
    [link=https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08408]paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08408[/link].
  sources:
    user_input: Time range and geometry of interest.
  sinks:
    raster: Cloud-free rasters.
  parameters:
    duration:
      Time window, in days, considered in the inference. Controls the amount of temporal context for
      inpainting clouds. Larger windows require more compute and memory.
    time_overlap:
      Overlap ratio of each temporal window. Controls the temporal step between windows as a
      fraction of the window size.
    min_tile_cover: Minimum RoI coverage to consider a set of tiles sufficient.
    max_tiles_per_time: Maximum number of tiles used to cover the RoI in each date.
    cloud_thr: Confidence threshold to assign a pixel as cloud.
    shadow_thr: Confidence threshold to assign a pixel as shadow.
    pc_key: Optional Planetary Computer API key.
