description:
  short_description: 
    Downloads the tiles from Global Land Analysis (GLAD) forest data that intersect with the user input geometry and time range, and merges them into a single raster.
  long_description:
    The workflow lists the GLAD forest products that intersect with the input
    geometry and time range, and downloads the filtered products. The downloaded
    products are merged into a single raster and classified. The result tiles have 
    pixel values categorized into two classes - 0 (non-forest) and 1 (forest). 
    This workflow uses the same forest definition as the Food and Agriculture 
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
  sources:
    input_item: Geometry of interest for which to download the GLAD forest extent data.
  sinks:
    merged_product: Merged GLAD forest extent product to geometry of interest.
    categorical_raster: Raster with the GLAD forest extent data.
