description:
  short_description: Generates shape files for similarly colored regions in the input raster.
  long_description:
    The workflow retrieves a remote raster and trains a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) over a subset
    of the input data with a fixed number of components. The GMM is then used to cluster all images
    pixels. Clustered regions are converted to polygons with a minimum size threshold. These
    polygons are then simplified to smooth their borders. All polygons of a given cluster are
    written to a single shapefile. All files are then compressed and returned as a single zip
    archive.
  sources:
    user_input: External references to raster data.
  sinks:
    result: Zip file containing cluster geometries.
  parameters:
    buffer:
      Buffer size, in projected CRS, to apply to the input geometry before sampling training points.
      A negative number can be used to avoid sampling unwanted regions if the geometry is not very
      precise.
    no_data: Value to use as nodata when reading the raster. Uses the raster's internal nodata value
      if not provided.
    clusters: Number of clusters to use when segmenting the image.
    sieve_size:
      Area of the minimum connected region. Smaller regions will have their class assigned to the
      largest adjancent region.
    simplify:
      Method used to simplify the geometries. Accepts 'none', for no simplification, 'simplify', for
      tolerance-based simplification, and 'convex', for returning the convex hull.
    tolerance:
      Tolerance for simplifcation algorithm. Only applicable if simplification method is 'simplify'.
    samples: Number os samples to use during training.
    bands: List of band indices to use during training and inference.
    alpha_index: Positive index of alpha band, if used to filter out nodata values.
